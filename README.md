# Ecommerce-App-Backend

## Description

I set out with this project to develop the backend for an ecommerce site that allows the user to add categories,tags, and products in order to simplify the shopping experience for the user as well as to optimize the inventory management for the business owner.  In doing so I learned how to use Insomnia and bettered my understanding of Sequelize.

## Installation

https://github.com/Jp0st/E-Commerce-App

In order to install this project you need to first clone the repository to your local machine. You then right click on the 'db' folder and run the following command : "mysql -u root -p".  After you enter your prompted password you will source the database using "source schema.sql".  You can close that terminal and open a new integrated terminal by right clicking your 'server.js' file.  From there you will need to both seed the database with "npm run seed" as well as install any necessary packages using "npm i".

## Usage

Once you have done all of the steps described in Installation you can simply run "npm start" in your integrated terminal and run the commands through your Insomnia application to test the functionality of the routes.
